## Custom programming language 
This project is developed as part of a University subject on "Program Compilers". This language takes the inpsiration from the english language and writing it is supposed to resemble writing in english.

### Examples

#### Some data types and basic functionalities

| Code in C | Code in 'english' programming language   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| int a; | Declare number a.                           |
| a = 5; | The number a takes value of 5.	           |
| char a; | Declare letter a. 		                   |
| a = ‘a’; | The letter a takes value of ‘a’.	       |
| int main(){}; | Function main with no arguments and return type number: |
| gets(a); | Load number and put it in a.            |
| puts(word); | Write the word content of “word”     |

#### Operators

| Code in C | Code in 'english' programming language |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| a = ‘a’; | The letter a takes value of ‘a’. 	     |
| a += 3;  | Add (3 to number a) then put it in number a.               |
| c = a+b; | Add (number b to number a) then put it in number c.        | 	
| a -= 3;  | Subtract (3 from number a) then put it in number a.        |
| c = a-b; | Subtract (number b from number a) then put it in number c  |
| a < b;   | The number a is lower than number b.    |
| a == b;  | The number a is equal to number b.      |
| a && b;  | a and b.	                             |
| a || b;  | a or b.                                 |

#### Flow control

| Code in C | Code in 'english' programming language |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| if(a == b){}  | If it’s true that number a is equal to b then:                    |
| else{}        | Else do.                                                          |
| elif(a < b){} | Else if it’s true that number a is lower than b then:             |
| For(int i =0; i < 6; i++){} | or values of counter i in range from 0 to 5, do:    |
| while(a > b){} | while it’s true that a is grater than b do:                      |
